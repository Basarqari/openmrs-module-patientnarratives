TODO
-----------------------------------

1. View html form entry output properly like this:
http://localhost:8088/openmrs22/module/htmlformentry/htmlFormEntry.form?encounterId=55

2. Automate "anonymous" user creation << give it required *privileges*.
Issues: the User need "setCreator" again, so who gonna set that in an unauthenticated environment?

3. Automate initial Concepts creation, Xform and HTML form creation

4. Make the design look good

5. Anonymous spam prevention using Captcha
